# Google text-to-speech 
Generates audio files from text. 

The API Google Text-to-Speech (https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech) in Google Cloud services offers advanced naturalistic voices (like Wavenet, Neural2). It also has advanced features, like the possibility of customizing and tunning voices. If you just need some basic synthetic-sounding text to speech using the standard engine, you can use'gTTS' library in Python https://pypi.org/project/gTTS/. 

In this **example** we will set up the API and run some Python code in the cloud to generate variations of a sentence for an experiment

### Set up Google Text-to-speech API
Once you are a GC user there are many services and APIs you can use.  Text to speech is just one of them https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech
- After becoming a Google cloud user you will probably have a default starter project "My First Project" or something like that. You will operate within that project.
